          <p class="content">Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is a novel class-discriminative localization technique, that can be used to make CNN based models interpretable. Grad-CAM highlights regions of the image the VQA model looks at while making predictions. Given an image and a caption or question about that image, the model shows where it looked while doing prediction.</p>

          <p class="content">Beam search, the standard work-horse for decoding outputs from neural sequence models like RNNs produces generic and uninteresting sequences. This is inadequate for AI tasks with inherent ambiguity — for example, there can be multiple correct ways of describing the contents of an image. The demo overcomes this by proposing a diversity-promoting replacement, <em>Diverse Beam Search</em> that produces sequences that are significantly different — with runtime and memory requirements comparable to beam search. The demo can be found <a href="http://dbs.cloudcv.org/captioning">here</a></p>

          <p class="content">The bot keeps monitoring the slack channels and if someone mentions the bot and asks a question about an Image then it replies back with its Answer using <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00468">Visual Question Answering</a>. The jobs sent by the bot are queued and are consumed by RabbitMQ workers that sends back the response.</p>

          <p class="content">Given an image and a natural language question about the image as a tweet mentioning @deshrajdry, the bot provides an accurate natural language answer as a reply to that tweet. This project involves use of Twitter Streaming API for replying and RabbitMQ for running the prediction job in a worker.

          <p class="content">Beacons and Stickers are small wireless sensors that you can attach to any location or object. They broadcast tiny radio signals which your smartphone can receive and interpret, unlocking micro-location and contextual awareness. The navigation for the different Office buildings and malls can be made much simpler using Beacons. The user needs to install the application and he can navigate easily to the nearby locations like different stores in a Mall. Implemented the whole android application along with the use of A* Search Algorithm for finding the shortest route</p>
