  <p class="content"> I am working as a Research Assistant in the <a target="_blank" href="https://mlp.ece.vt.edu/">Computer Vision Machine Learning and Perception Lab (CVMLP)</a>	at Virginia Tech. I am advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~dbatra/">Dr. Dhruv Batra</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~parikh/">Dr. Devi Parikh</a> (currently visiting researchers at Facebook AI Research). The problems that I work on lie at the intersection of Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My research interests focus on solving the problems related to humans understanding of AI Bots.</p>
