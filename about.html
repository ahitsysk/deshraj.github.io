  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <hr>
  <p class="content"> I am working as a Research Assistant in the <a target="_blank" href="https://mlp.ece.vt.edu/">Machine Learning and Perception Lab</a>	at Virginia Tech. I am advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~dbatra/">Dr. Dhruv Batra</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~parikh/">Dr. Devi Parikh</a> (currently visiting researchers at Facebook AI Research). The problems that I work on lie at the intersection of Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. My research interests focus on making AI more accurate, better understand human intentions, tendencies, and contexts. I also actively maintain the CloudCV project which aims to make AI research more reproducible.</p>
